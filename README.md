# ML-OAIP-dataset
ML-OAIP is the first multimodal remote sensing dataset for semantic segmentation and height estimation that integrates high-resolution SAR interferometric phase images, optical imagery, and SAR amplitude images.

*Introduction*
ML-OAIP dataset consists of 80 high-resolution optical images (2048 Ã— 2048 pixels), repeat-pass SAR Single Look Complex(SLC) data of the same area, and corresponding semantic and height labels. The image coverage primarily focuses on the central urban area of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, and extends to some surrounding rural areas. The region is predominantly flat plain, with elevations ranging from -8m to 18m. Diverse, unevenly distributed ground objects with significant scale variations pose substantial challenges for both SS and HE tasks.
